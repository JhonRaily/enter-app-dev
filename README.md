###  Plot
**Monkey D. Luffy** sets off on an adventure with his pirate crew in hopes of finding the greatest treasure ever, known as the **"One Piece."**.
---

There once lived a **pirate named Gol D. Roger**. He obtained wealth, fame, and power to earn the title of **Pirate King**. When he was captured and about to be executed, he revealed that his treasure called One Piece was hidden somewhere at the *Grand Line*. This made all people set out to search and uncover the One Piece treasure, but no one ever found the location of Gol D. Roger's treasure, and the Grand Line was too dangerous a place to overcome. Twenty-two years after Gol D. Roger's death, a boy named Monkey D. Luffy decided to become a pirate and search for Gol D. Roger's treasure to become the next Pirate King.

The man who had acquired everything in this world, the Pirate King, is Gol D. Roger. The final words he said at the execution tower were **"My treasures? If you want it, I'll let you have it. Look for it; I left all of it at that place."** These words sent many to the seas, chasing their dreams, headed toward the Grand Line, in search of One Piece. And a new age began! Seeking to be the greatest pirate in the world, young Monkey D. Luffy also heads toward the Grand Line in search of One Piece. With his diverse crew joining him along the way, consisting of a *swordsman, marksman, navigator, cook, doctor, archaeologist, cyborg-shipwright, musician and a fishman-helmsman* this will be one memorable adventure.

Gol D. Roger was known as the "Pirate King," the strongest and most infamous being to have sailed the Grand Line. The capture and execution of Roger by *the World Government* brought a change throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the existence of the greatest treasure in the world, **One Piece**. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece-which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame-and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title of the Pirate King. Enter Monkey D. Luffy, a **17-year-old boy** who defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a &wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun&, Luffy's reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: &the thought of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, the promised treasure.& Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach the most coveted of all fortunes-One Piece.

###  Terms

Grand Line
:  where the deadliest, most revered pirates in the world operate. While the East, North, South, and West Blue Oceans also suffer from piracy, the Grand Line is where the bigger cities, islands, and treasure troves are found for pirates to plunder.

The World Government
:  The World Government can be described as totalitarian to an absolute extent if not viewed as an autocratic oligarchy to some, as they often will make massive efforts to ensure that they remain in power, including the appropriation or elimination of any source of power that could be perceived as greater than their own.

Devil Fruit
:  Devil Fruits are mysterious, distinctive fruits scattered throughout the world, known for permanently granting their eaters superhuman powers and an equally permanent inability to swim. With only one notable exception, an individual can only acquire the powers of a single Devil Fruit and survive.
